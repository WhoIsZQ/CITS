# CITS

### Coding Meetup Group Challenge:

Incident Tracker for Day Care 
 
We are going to build a tool where teachers can log incidents that happen to children  This tool needs to be able to flag children who have multiple offenses.  Once a child has 3 offenses, the tool should alert day care administration.  The child should be flagged in the system and be put in an inactive state.  If the parent tries to enroll their child in another facility.  It should flag the child. 
 
Recap of basic things this app or website should do. - Register a child or pull information from an existing system. - Be able to log an incident. - Administration should be able to pull up a child and see how many incidents. - System should immediately flag a child that has 3 offenses. - Basic Data needed is Name, birth date, age, sex, parents name, social security number, (displayed like xxx-xx-4920). - Add Parents information (Name, email, phone number, address) 
 
Extra Credit - Program should send parent an automated message when there is an incident. - Once a child gets to 3 incidents.  There should be templates within the program that administration can select an automated message to send to the parent. - Be able to export all incidents as a pdf or word file for administration or parent.
